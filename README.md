# Data-Acquisition-Blog

This repository contains my data acquisition project for STAT 386. I have included my question of intest below:

Where are mass shootings concentrated within the United States? How many people have died in mass shootings in 2025 so far? How many people have been injured? 

My cleaning and EDA can be found in the data-analysis.ipynb file. This notebook is thoroughly commented to explain each step of the process. You can find the data source [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2025). 

I have also included a csv that I created with the cleaned dataset that I used for my analysis. The csv is called mass_shootings_2025.csv.

I have summarized my findings in a blog post on my personal website which you can find [here](https://ella-walker.github.io/github_pages_template/).
