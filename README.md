Where are mass shootings concentrated within the United States? How many people have died in mass shootings in 2025 so far? How many people have been injured? These are some of the questions that inspired my data acquisition project.

Here are the assignment instructions:
For this project, you need to gather a data on a topic that is of interest to you.  Your dataset should be original, meaning that you assemble it through a data API and/or web scraping (requests/BeautifulSoup - other scraping packages are ok too).  You should do the majority of your work in python (unless you have specifically discussed your project with and obtained permission from Dr. Kerby).  
1. Create an original dataset
2. Choose a topic interest that is not overly trivial
3. Be inspired by a question of interest
4. Have a minimum of 200 observations (rows) and 5 features (columns)
5. Have at least one numeric variable
6. Should be substantial enough to have a thorough exploratory data analysis applied and data story
